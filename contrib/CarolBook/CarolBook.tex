%%        Carol Songbook (CarolBook.tex)
%%        ==============================
%%
%%  Words transcribed by Christopher Rath.  My primary source of copyright
%%  dates and lyrical authorship was ``The Book of Common Praise'', (c)
%%  1938, published by the Anglican Book Centre, Toronto, Canada.
%%  Supplementary materials used were, ``Songs of Christmas'', a carol
%%  sheet printed each year by The Ottawa Citizen newspaper; The English
%%  Folksongs Archive (http://www.acronet.net/\~robokopp/english.html);
%%  and, ``Christmas, 100 Seasonal Favourites'', (c) 1992, published by
%%  Hal Leonard Publishing Corp.
%%  
%%  Compiled by Christopher Rath <christopher@rath.ca>.  I believe that all
%%  of the words to the carols contained in this file are in the public
%%  domain; I am aware that some of the music to these carols is still
%%  under copyright, however, no music is contained in this compliation.
